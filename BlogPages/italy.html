          With picture-postcard perfection, high alpine meadows and dramatic
          rocky hikes, there’s a multitude of experiences in the Braies valley.
          Lago di Braies is just the tip of the gorgeous lake-centred iceberg.
          <br /><br />
          Fed by alpine streams and underground springs, Lago di Braies lures
          travellers to its sparkling emerald waters. Surrounded by blonde
          shingle beaches and backed by sheer rocky cliffs, it’s a
          photographer’s dream location, an idyll in the Dolomites, and a
          pristine nature reserve. Set against the massive north wall of Croda
          del Becco (Seekofel) – one of the giants of the Dolomites – Lake
          Braies is sometimes blue-green, sometimes crystal clear, sometimes
          milky and at all times enchanting.

          <br /><br />
          Take a boat journey to magnetic beaches with mountains rising all
          around. Stroll past the quaint chapel on a slow amble through the
          forested path. Or hike the gruelling Rifugio Biella circuit to get up
          close to the domineering rock face constantly overlooking the lake.
          But most importantly, leave the picture-postcard lake behind and
          experience the Braies Valley beyond the hum of tourist buses idling in
          the Lago di Braies car park. Wander the beguiling Bagni di Braies
          Vecchia, explore the high alpine pastures of Prato Piazza and hike to
          one of the most complete and spectacular views of the Tre Cime towers.
          All just a stone’s throw from Lago di Braies.

              The Pragser Wildsee, or Lake Prags, Lake Braies is a lake in the
              Prags Dolomites in South Tyrol, Italy. It belongs to the
              municipality of Prags which is located in the Prags Valley. During
              World War II it was the destination of the transport of
              concentration camp inmates to Tyrol.

          <h2>2. WHERE IS LAGO DI BRAIES</h2>
          <hr />
          Lago di Braies, or The Pragser Wildsee in German, is located in the
          Braies Valley, which is in the northeast corner of the Italian
          Dolomites. Lake Braies is 16 kilometres from Dobbiaco (Tolbach).

          <br /><br />
          The valley and lake are part of the Fanes-Sennes-Braies nature park,
          the largest in the Dolomites. The area is formed by karstification
          where soluble rock has formed the grooves and crevices that shape the
          formidable mountains. It’s also responsible for the landslide which
          formed Lago di Braies.

            3. WHERE TO STAY FOR VISITING LAGO DI BRAIES & THE BRAIES VALLEY
          </h2>
          <hr />
          As a popular tourist destination, there’s no shortage of accommodation
          in the Braies Valley. However, it does get booked up very quickly so
          it’s important to plan ahead. If you want to stay on the lake, the
          only option is Hotel Lago di Braies. It’s a charming old hotel with
          plenty of history but it has seen better days.

          <br /><br />
          Staying up at Prato Piazza overnight means you’ll be in a prime
          location for sunrise and sunset, both of which are remarkable on the
          high plateau. There are two options on Prato Piazza, Hohe Gaisl and
          Rifugio Prato Piazza. Both are next door to each other, so the early
          morning views as the sun hits the opposite mountains is equally as
          stunning from each.
