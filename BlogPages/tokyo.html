          There aren’t many cities in the world that quite span the size of
          Tokyo. Due to it’s sheer scale, uncovering Japan’s largest city may
          seem like a daunting task – but it doesn’t have to be with my detailed
          Tokyo itinerary to help you out! With its vibrant and bustling city
          streets, tranquil green parks, stunning vistas and remarkable history,
          spending 6 days in Tokyo should be at the top of your itinerary for a
          visit to Japan. Whether you’re staying for the first time or you’re a
          regular visitor there are loads of incredible attractions in Japan’s
          capital city so you’ll never be lost for things to see and do.

          <h2>1. How to spend 6 days in Tokyo on a mid range budget</h2>
          <hr />
          To really be an Invisible Tourist on any trip, staying in a centrally
          located hotel is of utmost importance if you want to maximise your
          travel experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          In Tokyo it means you’ll spend less time getting around and more time
          exploring the different neighbourhoods, UNESCO World Heritage sites,
          wandering the energetic streets and savouring the culinary delights
          that make Tokyo world-famous. The hotel I’ve recommended below is for
          travellers with a mid range budget, in a central location (Shibuya)
          and only a few moments walk to train stations.

          <br />
          <br />

          Make use of Shinkansen – Japanese Bullet Trains. They are the most
          efficient way to get to and from Tokyo. I’ll discuss these in more
          detail at the conclusion of this itinerary. As Japan has become such a
          popular destination for tourists in recent years, it also helps if you
          are aware of the issues that this influx of tourists has had on local
          communities. Learn what you can do to not look like a tourist and
          avoid contributing to Japan’s overtourism issues. You may also wish to
          consider venturing out to some destinations in Japan off the beaten
          path.

            <p class="imageDescription">
              Make use of Shinkansen – Japanese Bullet Trains. They are the most
              efficient way to get to and from Tokyo. Contrary to popular
              belief, you DO NOT need to buy a Japan Railpass before you visit,
              especially if you’re travelling with a mid range budget! The
              Shinkansen, colloquially known in English as the bullet train, is
              a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan. Initially, it was
              built to connect distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, the capital,
              to aid economic growth and development. Running at speeds of up to
              320 km/h, the shinkansen is known for punctuality (most trains
              depart on time to the second), comfort (relatively silent cars
              with spacious, always forward facing seats), safety (no fatal
              accidents in its history) and efficiency. The Tokaido shinkansen
              is the only profitable high speed rail route in the world. It's
              expensive because it's the best way to travel between cities. It's
              competition is airplanes.

                led to the current situation of a national Shinkansen network,
                which completely changed the face of Japan. Travel times were
                shortened and vibration was alleviated, making it possible for
                more convenient business and pleasure trips, but I have to say
                that the project just made all the [connecting] cities part of
                Tokyo."</i

          <h2>2. Where to stay in Tokyo</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I’ve personally stayed in four hotels in Tokyo now and I can I
            highly recommend each for different reasons:
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Shibuya:</b> My favourite is Dormy Inn Premium, Shibuya
            ドーミーイン PREMIUM 渋谷神宮前. If you’ve been looking at Dormy
            Inn, I highly recommend you lock it in! The hotel is in such a great
            location: Tucked away into a quiet street but still in the centre of
            all the action, strategically placed near two main Metro arteries
            which makes getting around the city a breeze. It’s About 5min walk
            to JR Harajuku station and about 8min walk to JR Shibuya station.
            <br />
            Countless shops and restaurants are within walking distance. I
            stayed on the 3rd floor, on train line side (as per my request based
            on room tips on TripAdvisor). My window was literally next to the
            train line but train noise was never an issue, didn’t even notice
            them go by!
            <br />
            Room was very clean, a little small but that’s to be expected for
            Tokyo. Pillows were a bit firm for my liking but they’re easy to get
            used to. English-speaking staff were very helpful. Wifi was fast.
            Despite other reviews, I thought the breakfast was more than
            adequate, with both Japanese and Western-style hot breakfasts cooked
            on the spot to suit both sweet and savoury tastes.

            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Shinjuku :</b> If you’re looking to stay in Shinjuku, I can
            recommend the IBIS Hotel Shinjuku. While my room was super tiny as
            expected, it had everything I needed, was clean and comfortable.
            It’s in a great location just a few minutes walk to Omoide Yokocho
            (Piss Alley), Godzilla Street and Shinjuku station is about a 10
            minute’s walk. I also rate the café 3rd Burger beneath the hotel.
            Delicious and fresh burgers that are really cheap, too!

            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Minato: </b>I can also highly recommend lovely Shiba Park Hotel.
            Located in a super convenient location near Hamamatsucho monorail
            station and Daimon metro stops makes it a breeze when travelling to
            and from Haneda airport and around Tokyo. The Tokyo Tower is just
            around the corner as is Zojo-ji Temple. Shiba Park Hotel is also in
            a handy spot to get the monorail over to Odaiba to see teamlab
            Borderless. The buffet breakfast is wonderful and there’s also a
            number of convenience stores a just few steps away if needed.

          <h2>3. Things to do in Tokyo</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            One last thing before we jump into my day-by-day Tokyo neighbourhood
            guide below! Did you know there are some small, locally guided tours
            of each neighbourhood you can add to your Tokyo itinerary? These are
            a great way to meet people with similar interests during your trip
            and support local businesses along the way.
          </p>

          <p>
            Do you enjoy being organised like me? It’s a good idea to book some
            activities in advance and add them to your Tokyo itinerary. Allow
            yourself to have an authentic Japanese experience by taking a small
            group tour with a Tokyo local guide from MagicalTrip! Here are a few
            ideas to get you started:
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Sumo Morning Practice Tour :</b>A must-do when in Tokyo. As the
            sumo tournament is only held 3 times per year in Tokyo, it’s easy to
            miss. Watching the sumo perform their morning training is a great
            way to see them up close if your trip doesn’t coincide with the
            tournament! <br /><br />
            <b>Shibuya Bar Hopping Tour : </b>I have personally experienced this
            one, it’s so much fun (read my detailed review for what to expect in
            Shibuya at night)! Lock in this enjoyable tour to experience
            nightlife in this exciting area. Enjoy delicious local cuisine and
            drinks at hidden izakaya pubs you wouldn’t find on your own.

            <br /><br />

            <b>Shinjuku Night Foodie Tour: </b>
            If you’re anything like me and can’t get enough of wagyu beef and
            sake, you won’t want to miss this experience! Eat your way through 3
            foodie locations in Shinjuku and watch a professional sushi chef
            prepare fresh fish in front of you.

            <br /><br />

            <b>Harajuku Kawaii & Pop Culture Tour : </b>Here’s one for the
            kawaii fans! Learn more about Japanese pop culture, dine in a
            monster café (yes, you read that correctly) and finish by taking a
            relaxing tour of Meiji Shrine

            <p class="imageDescription">
              Let’s cut straight to the chase – the Robot Restaurant is probably
              one of the weirdest experiences in the world! Imagine 10-foot tall
              robots, sexy queens of the galaxy, explosions, space gorillas,
              40-foot-long robotic snakes, and a ridiculous amount of laser
              beams! Take all that and multiply it by 100! Yes, it is the
              craziest bar/restaurant you’ll ever visit, but it’s also very
              impressive. Word is they spend millions on the production, so
              tickets admittedly don’t come cheap. Like most shows, prices vary
              depending on days and times, but you’ll usually be looking to pay
              between £40 and £70. It may sound pricey, but this bizarre
              experience is a lot of fun and something that you’ll never forget.

          <h2>4. Concluding what to do in Tokyo over 6 days</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>
            I’m not sure why some people choose to spend only 2 or 3 days in
            Tokyo when there are so many different neighbourhoods to explore and
            sights to see! Take the extra time, add another few days to your
            Tokyo itinerary and allow yourself to really experience this
            awe-inspiring city in the way it deserves. Why rush? You’ll thank
            yourself for it later!
          </p>

          <p>
            As I’m sure you’ll agree, there was al LOT of walking in this Tokyo
            itinerary, but it’s handy to know that the city’s extensive public
            transportation options are always nearby if you wish.
            <br /><br />

            Although it may look like my travel buddy and I crammed a lot into
            Tokyo, I can honestly say we never felt rushed. Because we were
            prepared it allowed us to leisurely stroll between many attractions
            and enjoy taking our time uncovering the wonders that make this
            beautiful city so unique. Travelling The Invisible Tourist way is
            about being efficient and making the best use of your travel time.

            <br /><br />
            No need to stress about the language barrier. I detail exactly why
            in my complete Japan itinerary. And, if you’re feeling adventurous
            find out how I learnt Japanese fast for travelling. You’ll be saying
            “こんにちは” (konnichiwa) before you know it!
