          The gateway to the world: This is Hamburg's label which for some,
          might be a rather daring claim, but as a major port city, Hamburg's
          maritime background contributed to the creation of the city's strong
          identity. Hamburg is Germany's second largest city and one of the
          country's richest cities. At first glance, I'd say Hamburg has a
          dynamic spirit infused in all its attractions, architecture, culinary
          delights and residents. So what to do in Hamburg during a first-time
          visit? We ditched the maps and went on a treasure hunt to discover
          Hamburg's vibrant districts.

          <br /><br />
          To figure out what to do in Hamburg, you need to first decide the aim
          and outcome of your visit. For instance, we decided to have a cultural
          and wellness visit in Hamburg, during which, we found incredible photo
          spots, ate great food and discovered the artsy side of the city.
          However, for those in search of a more incandescent side of Hamburg,
          known that this city is sometimes referred to as Germany's party
          capital. This is because of its insane stag dos which take place on
          Reeperbahn, a party street located in the entertainment district St.
          Pauli or Sternschanze. Reeperbahn is also known as the city's
          red-light district.

          <hr />
          Our Hamburg itinerary started with a relaxing walk around the world's
          largest warehouse district: Speicherstadt. It is located in the port
          of Hamburg, within the HafenCity quarter and since 2015 it is part of
          the UNESCO World Heritage Site. The warehouses were created with
          entrances from land and water and designed in a Neo-Gothic red brick
          outer layer with terracotta ornaments. You can enter the oldest
          warehouse which houses the International Maritime Museum.

              foundations, oak logs, in this particular case. It is located in
              the port of Hamburg—within the HafenCity quarter—and was built
              from 1883 to 1927.

          We first fell in love with Elbe River during our romantic Dresden
          itinerary. With your Hamburg City Cards you can get the river ferry,
          or better yet, you can book a trip with the HafenCity RiverBus, a cool
          amphibious vehicle that combines a city tour with a harbour cruise.

              Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, 110 kilometres
              northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is 1,094 km.

          Alstervergnügen, where visitors can enjoy a variety of food and
          drinks, as well as live music. It's a fantastic place for a romantic
          walk and photography opportunities.

              The Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg Germany has finally
              opened on the 11th of January, 2017. Elbphilharmonie has been
              designed by Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron on top of the
              Kaispeicher, an old Warehouse from the 60s used to store Cocoa
              beans. The contrasting images of the old conventional Kaispeicher
              with its red bricks and the modern all-glass mass of the
              Elbphilharmonie reflecting the river’s blue above it make for a
              quite outstanding landmark for the German city which lacks a
              distinct landmark. The newly designed building includes a concert
              hall with 2100 seating and a chamber music hall for 550 persons,
              but that is not all there is to it. The Elbphilharmonie, itself,
              is the central attraction of a city-like complex which contains,
              otherwise, a public plaza, a hotel, 45 luxury apartments,
              restaurants, a health and fitness center, and conference
              facilities.

          If you love visiting cities for their architectural details, then you
          will love the City Hall. On the outside, the City Hall is a
          neo-renaissance gem, with a balcony surmounted by Hammonia, the
          Hamburg's patron goddess. Hammonia is known to represent the Hanseatic
          values of Hamburg: freedom, peace, prosperity, harmony, welfare and
          trade.

              quite some time for this distinctive building to become the
              Hamburg icon it is today. After several relocations, fires and
              other turmoil, the current City Hall is the sixth edition in
              Hamburg's history.

          love the city and its vibe. It's always so exciting to visit a new
          destination which is suitable for such a wide range of travellers. As
          a couple writing primarily for those in search of soft adventure,
          romance and culture, we were very pleased to have finally seen the
          Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg.
